Title: Ising model and its application in community detection
Speaker: Feng Zhao
Abstract: Statistical physics have close relation with information theory, both of which are based on probability theory.
There are a lot of works which uses the concept from statistical physics to solve problems in information theory and vice versa.
In this talk, I will introduce Ising model, a concept from statistical physics and its application in
community detection, a topic of general interest in information theory society. Using Ising model we study the phase transition phenonmenon
in community detection and propose an approximate estimator to achieve
the exact recovery of community labels.
