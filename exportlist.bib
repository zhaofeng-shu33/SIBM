 abstract = {The authors focus on developing standardized measures for models of structure in interpersonal relations. A theorem is presented which yields expectations and variances for measures based on triads. Random models for these measures are discussed and the procedure is carried out for a model of a partial order. This model contains as special cases a number of previously suggested models, including the structural balance model of Cartwright and Harary, Davis's clustering model, and the ranked-clusters model of Davis and Leinhardt. In an illustrative exmaple, eight sociograms are analyzed and the general model is compared with the special case of ranked clusters.},

  abstract  = {This paper studies the computational complexity of Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms with finite-valued Markov random fields on a finite regular lattice as target distributions. We state conditions under which the complexity for approximate convergence is polynomial in n, the number of variables, approximate convergence takes time O(n log n) as n → ∞ if the target field satisfies certain spatial mixing conditions. Otherwise, if the field has a potential with finite interaction range independent of n, the complexity is exponential in ny, with $y < 1$, which is still more favourable than enumerating all the states. When the interaction range grows with n, the algorithms can converge exponentially in n. Analogous results are provided for an expectation approximated by an average along the chain.},
